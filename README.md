### Table of Contents: 
1. [Youtube API Call](https://github.com/adonovan7/YoutubeAnalysis/blob/master/apiCall.py)
	* pulls comments for a specified video from the API
2. [Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/adonovan7/YoutubeAnalysis/blob/master/Youtube_Analysis.ipynb)
	* conducts natural language processing to parse comments
	* performs sentiment analysis through machine learning algorithms to classify data as positive, negative, or neutral 
3. [Dashboard Script](https://github.com/adonovan7/YoutubeAnalysis/blob/master/dash/Dashboard.py)
	* provides an interactive platform for visually analyzing results
	* written in Plotly's Dash, which is built on the Plotly.js, React, and Flask platforms
