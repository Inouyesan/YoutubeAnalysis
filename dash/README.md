# Dashboard for Comment Analysis

### Created with Plotly's Dash platform

* to run the dashboard, type `Python3 Dashboard6.py` into the terminal and wait for it to load (this step can take a while)
* enter `http://127.0.0.1:8050` into your browser to view the dash locally

The pie chart represents the percent of the comments that were labeled as "positive", "negative", or "neutral" by each model. This allows us to see how the models are performing and check whether they give relatively consistent ratios. 

The bar chart shows the top words in the comment corpus set and can be filtered to show top words in positive comments, negative comments, and neutral comments. This is useful for observing which words may have had the biggest impact on the classification models.
