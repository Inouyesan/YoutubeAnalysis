This shows how Neymar getting injured completely demoralized Brazil. I kinda knew Brazil was already gonna lose but I never knew it'd be like this. @@@
Hahahaha I love to watch this so much. No matter how long. Fuck Brazil <3 @@@
Karma. Theres a lot of poor people but Brazil 
could afford World Cup, They got $100 billion by FIFA in return so that what its all about. @@@
Chelsea had 6 players out there @@@
The Biggest rape in the football history @@@
I was at a camp during this time and didn't have access to Internet and TV so they only said that Germany won, not even the score. (It was only me and the Germans at the camp who cheered for Germany the other 30+ campers cheered for Brazil) @@@
One of the best football games played ever.....just amazing! Magnificent! @@@
Haha Never Gets Old @@@
The most legend Brazil defenders and players of all time 2014...real joke @@@
Well deserved brazil. well deserved. This match showed the world your real worth. It will remain the biggest humiliation ever...until you score a 7-1 over Germany in ANOTHER world cup IN BRAZIL @@@
My brother was watching the game in the living room, right after goal number two I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth came back a couple of minutes later "Are they still showing replays of the 2nd goal ?" "Nope germany scored AGAIN !!!!" @@@
LMFAOOOOOOOO  @@@
I like germany team @@@
whatever germans learnt it from South Americans:-)) @@@
Brazil made so many people cried in football games and what you do so shall you reap lolssssssssssssssss this is your time to cry now sorry to say ..... @@@
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS LIVE AND I CRIED LAUGHING @@@
*Germany - 4 wins in the World Cup cumulatively*
2014, 1990, 1974, 1954

*Brazli- 5 wins*
1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, 2002 (none rather recent I'd say!)

Brazil has been runner up twice, Germany 4 times!

C'mon Deutschland! Win in 2018! We need to DOMINATE this championship, just like we DOMINATED Brazil then! @@@
Thanks God i am witness of these unforgettable moments. Though it was one sided but Germany created history. @@@
Will not forget this match , i was just arguing with my colleagues day before match that Germany will win this , When match started i was calling them and non of them was responding :P  But so sorry for Brazilian fans. @@@
I won a few hundred dollars on this game. Germany all the way @@@
GEEEERRRMAAANNNNYYYYYYY @@@
The absolute scum of football, destroyed.  Gotta love Germany. @@@
at 2:23 he said Brazil scored like WTF @@@
David Luiz should be responsible for that back line tho @@@

Brazil that night were a shambolic blend of colourful boots, flailing limbs, afros and tears. Nice to see. @@@
In Brazil, they now have an expression for when someone makes a stupid mistake, e.g. a gaffe by a politician: "And Germany scores again." @@@
Now imagine if Brazil had won and Argentina lost. 2014 final was awesome, for the whole time everyone were kept on their toes. @@@
I was on holiday in Fuertaventura that night, saw it in a German pub called Tirol. Absolute best night ever  @@@
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO @@@

When i woke up.then i just asked to my sister....how score??? She said.. 3-0...i said.. i guess brazil was 3... no... germany 3 brazil 0...are you sure? Then i just watched....oh no..it was just started play... @@@
Anclusss Brazil 7-1 @@@
When you have a test and you come back and watch this just to give you more confidence... @@@
lol julio cesar so stupid lol @@@
Fuck Brazil @@@
The moment Brazil lost the world cup was the moment Thiago Silva, the guy who was in charge of the Brazilian defence, got a second yellow card in the previous match for jumping in front of the goalie when trying to kick the ball out (or some other similar stupid stunt).

If Thiago Silva and Neymar were on the pitch, Brazil would have had half a chance, but still would have lost in my opinion. @@@
British commentary is the best football commentary. @@@
Brazil lost more because of its incompetence in 2014 than Germany's supremacy in football. They were psychologically shaken, Germany did not play against Brazil on an equal footing. This has not happened And for you it is so surreal to have made 7-1 in Brazil that you even proclaim the superiority that Brazil has in world football. This only shows the level that you put Brazil in the history of world football. And what is known is that if such a team loses therefore, it is because something very disorganized occurred with this team, it is because something wrong happened, because the selection that lost was even the best of all time, surreal. What happened to them ? Not to mention that Germany only appeared to the world after having won the then favorite, great and famous Brazil of all time. This only implies for how much Brazil is worth to the world, and to the world history of soccer. I conclude that Germany is far from unbeatable for Brazil. And if Brazil lose, it's because a great selection of history lost to another team. And Germany is far from unbeatable that they drew with Senegal and almost handed the cup to Argentina if Higuain and Messi had not been so bad. I also conclude that Brazil only lost to itself. It was 7-1, it was, 7 is a lot, it's in history, yes, but it's so shocking and unbelievable because it was with Brazil, do not forget that. And so everyone proclaims how big Brazil is.
- Do not forget the respect that Brazil had before starting that game. Brazil is a story. And only the weak and their envious ones speak of their weakness. Score @@@

The difference between Germany and other nationals like Spain, Italy or France. The latter have respect of the opponent, after a certain point in then they stop...

I wish I put a bet on this game. Imagine the odds for 7-1 Germany @@@
In 2010 after germany lost against italy, i said to my friends, they should not be sad, because in 2014 we will win the world cup in brazil - could you imagine. Now you sat there, in front of a big tv in a pub with crowds of people and saw germany destroying brazil with 1:7 to win the world cup later on. I still cant believe this happened. I was and i am still shocked, that we hit brazil in the heart this way. If i was a young brazil kid, i would be like: when im older, im gonna lead the revenge...anyways...this was brutal. No words can explain. @@@

Poor brazilians @@@
2:29 Enzo Ferrari? @@@
I have a feeling that most international media (and even brazillian media) try to paint this as a dark day for us Brazillians, believe me, we were all having good laughs around here. Of course a few hardcore fans were sad, but 95% of Brazillian population couldn`t care less and partied and drank the same way that day lol ! I remember me and my friend watching and actually rooting fot Germany to score more goals, we wanted to see it hitting the 10 goals mark. Good times, good times ! @@@
RIP brazillians @@@
it would be 10-1

I had summer school on that day and I remember me wanting to go home because I am hyped for this match up. But when my mom picked me up she said that we have to go to Costco real quick. Thank god the game was on in one of the big tvs and I watched the first 30 mins there. At first it was just me but as the game went on people started coming. To the point that the workers who were supposed to clear us out stood there and watched too. What a day @@@
I am glad that I had saved this match as video file. I will make sure my sons to watch them in the future. @@@
Even Pele said Philippe Coutinho should have played in this world cup @@@
Looking back on this now in hindsight, it's always the Brazilian fans and fans that are against Germany that are all, like, "oh..this was horrible."  But when you look at comments from the fans of Germany...or even the "anti-Brazil"  fans, they always seem happy with the 7-1 outcome. @@@

I remember being in my room and my mom and family watching the match live. I don't like football that much so I didn't really care who won. Wen I heard the announcer screm 4:0 I actually got up to look who got gangraped by the other team this early into the game and lo and behold: Our team absolutely annihilating Brazil. Honestly seeing the Fans cry after being this cocky for so long really brought a sick sense of satisfaction to me. @@@
Yep, German behind the wheel @@@

Germany was the champion in and out of the stadiums. It captivated the population and presented a magnificent football. A charismatic selection! 
Brazil, unfortunately, is in its worst moment in football. We do not have more great players like we did some time ago. The current sport of Brazilians are academics and martial arts.
I live in So Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, and when I was a kid, I played soccer every day, every time. Boys do not play football anymore. They are addicted to cell phones, and at most, they attend academies. A big hug to all, and congratulations to Germany for the perfect football they have presented. @@@
the excuse from brazillians that they lost because injury of neymar is a pussy excuse , germany easily replaced khedira in the final with kramer, and just in a blink of an eye kramer goes injuried. and replaced again by schurrle and still won the world cup. @@@
Poor Brazil @@@
People said germany wins because neymar and silva didn't play... But what they didn't know before WC 2014 they had friendly with complete squad bothside and germany still won 3-2 @@@
Hello People! From Brasil here! Next friendly upcoming, against Germany haha. I hope Germany it will lost. 3x2 for Brasil. @@@
hope? real 7-1 ^^ @@@
that was so cool ! @@@

In the 15 minute between 1st and 2nd half, J. Low has told the players: don't score more goals in brazil  in the second half, 5 goals are enough,  but  unfortunately while low is talking to the players, schurrle was in the bathroom. @@@

That one got Brazil is like purposely given to them as to not humiliate too much. @@@
even when they had the chance neuer was like nah @@@
the fact that germans especially neuer getting furious on letting that goal in makes this more salty. Love this! Oh the dominant germans. what a team that is! the manager managed to stuff in all best players in that german team. @@@
i am waiting that more from 30 years!!! hahaha.... @@@
So geil das zu sehen @@@
 @@@
the reason for brazil's loss is because no more new talent rising in this recent year, maybe only neymar, how can you compare this generation with the golden age from 2002? @@@
I'm Italian and i'v supported Germany. I will not forget the 2 finals, 1970/1994, we've lost against them and I was not even born. And anyway they are the most annoying supporters in all the world. 7-1 forever in history @@@

i love how the germans play. so calm and coordinated, and skillful but selfless. respect. @@@
Andrew Kisel the selflessness can work to our disadvantage too. Instead of actually acoring they will just pass on the ball and it can get REALLY frustrating. @@@

Who's watching in 2018 @@@
At the crucial part of the World Cup especially in the semi finals, Brazil had missing their best 2 players. Imagine if this the Finals, how would the brazillians react then. I certainly hope the crowd got a full refund of their tickets. Hope the 2018 one that the brazillian goal keeper won't be in this one. He was totally crap. 7 - 1, I got to get my head around that. @@@
Juga did you see the Brazilian crowd, they were reduced to tears. They basically flooded the whole stadium. And you are correct about their defence. This was in the Brazils home crowd, what were the soccer players (Brazil) thinking. @@@
C'mon germany! Soccer is the only thing we do right! @@@
