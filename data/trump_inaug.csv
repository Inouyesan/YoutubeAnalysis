	Hispanic for Trump!;

	This speech literaly ripped off the Dark Knight Rises, during Bane's speech;
	Poop him;
	He's speeching like a communist leader;
	Play this with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shaNFDyC5UI playing in the background, starting from 0:10.;
	Just do it. It doesn't get much better.;
	do not take my transgressions lightly or my recent instances of unfruitfulness, as they are a symbol of how small man is right now.;

	stop digging and look up. you pretend that you have believed in God all this time but you havent, you live as though all you have is your time on earth. i understand there is so much unexplained. that is why i was created, I am here to explain. I am not ready to explain yet, it will be a process. I will require my medicine and a personal living place, and a lot of reading. I will account for everything,, even deaths that seem meaningless and unfair. Events that seem iinevitable and just ways of nature. You must understand that your Apostle has lived in a box his whole life. And i do not say these things out of pride or some form of compensation. I say it with absolute sureness and a desire to fulfill my destiny, despite all the pettiness and darkness that has filled the voids that could of been filled with frankness and righteousness. the 2nd coming is not near, not even close. God is making plans to create an age of righteous diplomacy, ignore the noise, it is difficult but I only find it difficult because im surrounded by weakness and pettiness 24/7. Now my mother is another story, she is a victim much like myself, despite there being a whole summer where she didnt seem to sense my constant sensation of damnation after one of my friends sexually manipulated me and inspired spiritual bewilderment for at least 6 years give or take. Some people do not understand how this transition will work, too much resistance right? I beg to differ, see there are two forces, God and Lucifer. Right now the picture is a cloud of darkness with a little light somewhere in that cloud. Lucifer is having a hay day constantly, he has never felt better. But what people do not realize is that there is unbalance. If we can get to a point where we are doing as much good as bad that would look good, better than it looks now. But imagine if we could do the opposite of how it is right now. Lucifer would still be there yes, but we would make his inevitable anticipation of damnation far more excruciating, because right now, he often forgets that he is even damned. That is not good, at all. That is quite horrifying actually. See even if I am damned I will still resist because why would i submit to something that has damned me? It makes no sense. Now some people are just repulsive and choose darkness and grab ahold at the last minute. Humanity needs Jesus, more than ever. I cannot be silenced, not because of pride or whatever witty remarks or memes that have been created but because I am much like Lucifer, except I want to enlighten you, rather than cloud your vision with lust and man made conceptions of audacity or decisiveness. It will probably be a couple years before I formulate everything. Maybe my whole life, I am not sure, as I will have to account for everything. And I mean everything. Anything you could possibly think of I will put in layman's terms in a sense. Now I highly doubt anyone will want to see me when I arrive in heaven because I will be a reminder of how repulsive mankind became, especially considering every being in Heaven loves mankind on a level that you could not even possibly imagine. I can very much imagine I will just instantly appear in a massive home full of whatever I would want which is private. Now if humanity resists my destiny enough, God will have no quarrels taking me. None at all. And no thats not a threat of suicide. That would be pure unadulterated hypocrisy. One may argue what i am doing is  damnable since it could potentially lead others astray and contort the meaning of God and his sons word, But i do not wish the  damnation of anyone so therefore I will not damn anyone, that is on you. I know many of you think that I deface God, and taint his word and intentions and meanings, but at this point you and you alone are responsible for your salvation, at least personally I feel that if you are weak enough to be led astray then God is better off without you.   Lucifer expands on our imperfections while God tries to expand on our perfections. I realize how elementary and confusing everything I am saying is right now. But be patient, those of the new world will see every word of my works in time.;

	Currently, the richest 1% hold about 38% of all privately held wealth in the United States, while the bottom 90% held 73% of all debt. The richest 1% in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90%. (NY times);
	"78% of American full time workers are living from paycheck-to-paychec;
71% are in deb;
56% of us can barely save $100 per month.  (Career Builder)";
	the vast majority of us fall under this category. we might not be living out on the streets but alot of us are struggling. Alot of us are one medical emergency from complete and utter bankruptcy. Average college graduate has $30,000 in student loan debt. 1/5 of college graduates have over $100,000 in student loan debt. Home prices continue to rise 3 times faster than the rate of inflation.;
	These are full time employees these are not people who lack dignity. these are not people who are sitting around twitting their thumbs. These are people who are working hard day in and day out often times with 2 jobs 3 jobs and they still can't put food on the table for their kids because wages have been stagnant since the 1970's.

	Americans are forever informed that there is no such thing as a corruption free government, as foreign powers get richer, they will seek to control America the way they see fit, therefore Americans must look past the face value presented by the establishment through big mainstream media, to judge them by their actions, given enough research is done to get information not only presented by big main stream media, but small sized media,;

	My President ;
	Thank you Abba Father YHWH God in Heaven for placingtheman Donald J Trump in the office of the President of the United States to help bring our Nation back to you. Forgive us Abba Fatherfor the previous eight years of filth and debauchery asthis nation turned our back on you. Forgive us for allowing the evil that was turning this Nation against you under the former leadership as we sat by idle and did nothing to stop it!! I thankthe OnlyLord and Savior Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ) for His greatmercy, for not bringing the full destruction from His mighty power before the appointed time, a punishment that we deserve. But Through His wonderful Love and tender mercy has appointed Our President DJT for such a time as this. That in theseend ofdays before His Greatand Mighty return,whenYeshuatakes his people into the clouds to meet Him in the air, He has raised a man into Leadership of the United States toHelp prepare the Way for all to Know the saving Grace of Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ) before He passes judgment on the world. Please today, If you do knowthe Lord Jesus Christ, give yourheart, your life, your salvation to Him today before it is too Late.Accept and believethat Only His blood, that He Shed on thecross at Calvary atoned for your sins and the sins for all mankind.Confess your sins to Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ) and acknowledge and accept this free gift of grace. Yeshua (Jesus)Loves you and cares about you. Time is short. We are in the 11th Hour. Do not Wait another second. The appointed time is almost here!!! Please Give your life to Jesus Christ today. I pray in the name of and by the blood ofYeshua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). Amen;
	What a difference in gesture control.  Stammer has nearly disappeared!  One year later at the #SOTU, Trump  has shown great improvement!;
	My apologies that our economy  is flourishing, with federal tax-cuts allowing companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot to actually offer bonuses to longtime employees, (even though these service jobs are generally intended for teens, for 1st-time-workers).;
	    Maybe it's nothing but a conservative boost, a temporary leg-up, but America's root-problems still do lie far deeper than the shock-pads that stimulate someone's chest on the eve of death. But maybe it's in this competitive nature of inner division: red versus blue states, black versus white, death-penalty, abortion, childhood trauma, and whichever other divisions separate Trump (and now America, with him as head), from all other nations. ;
	    America has provided seed-money for 100's of countries to gain their own 'leg-ups'	 at the cost of disenfranchising our own citizens. We still donate over a $1 billion per year to Egypt, to Nigeria, to Afghanistan, the Philippines, Mexico, El Salvador...and the list goes on. And before you claim, "But you're stealing oil!", look at past colonial treatment of native citizenry and you'll see we learned our lesson relatively quick and well. (Apartheid? Suez? Falklands, Algeria, Sudan Civil War, world-wide female circumcision, HSBC money-laundering, Russia-Crimea, Armenia,....And the list goes on.;
	     That the United States contributes more donations to international and domestic aid relief: the Red Cross, Doctor's without Borders, etc., than all other western countries combined... America's post-war payoffs and training/technical aid to Germany and Japan, who'd only recently been A-bomb targets, have seen both countries now dominate in the fields of electronics, automobiles and technology.;
	     Capitalism is still the absolute best economic model, the relative swan-song in terms of benefiting investiture among R&D, among incentive-based investment, among optimism and opportunity, but increasingly, many Americans and foreigners have taken these self-same relative opportunities and economic/political freedoms to do nothing but strain an economy which requires a motivated work-force.          Ahh...Nationalism. "I hate this place which brought over my ancestors to pluck tiny bindles of organic wool.";
	     "Black lives matter!" Yes, they do. But when one lives in communities dominated by black-on-black gang-warfare, minority-based crimes reflect certain racial lines, and unfortunately are still policed by a generation of cops who were the only ones to pass the requisite mental/physical/moralistic testing back in the day. In fact, I believe somewhere around a quarter of Oakland's police force was let go back around the supposed eruption of citizen 'cop-killings'	 though this was before they lowered all 3 (again, physical, mental, moralistic) bars to admit more women and minorities), and I'm not being intentionally mean. I've always maintained that cops should be more representative of the communities they serve, but they did have to substantially lower the bar	 a problem affecting America across all boards;
	     While I was in college, affirmative-action was playing out in courtrooms across the country. No school was more on the forefront of protestation than mine against the recent cancellations	 though honestly, the policy had mainly served to enrich only the Latino and African-American Studies' Departments. Aside from collegiate sportsmen and women, both public and private universities suddenly established a quota system among their admissions' departments. At any rate, all colleges which had traditionally accepted only the top 1 percent of high school seniors from across the nation, and those who had perfect SAT I and II scores, were suddenly mandated by state law to allow in the top percentages of minorities from similar or inner-city schools. So, say Stanford only takes 2 students from southern Ohio: Jeffrey was valedictorian with a 4.3gpa from Toledo (b/c of honour's and AP-inflated grades), with Lisa his close number 2 with a 4.23gpa. They're both white: one male, one female, (and yes, men win out in my example because of my misogyny, hah, hah:). But since Lakisha is valedictorian of Southern Toledo High School with only a 3.86 without honors, even though her SAT's are only average, (and yes, I realize there's a cultural bias attributed to IQ-Tests...), Lakisha, not Lisa, gets southern Ohio's second spot into Stanford. Which she happily accepts;
	      Now, Josh and Lakisha both attend Stanford in the fall. Josh is prepared for multi-variable calculus and applied organic chemistry, since his parents made him take AP Calculus at high school, and chemistry at the local community college. ;
	     All the while, Lakisha attempts Intro to Math and failed miserably, even in English 101, she receives C-minuses, with comments such as 'begging the question' and 'point being?'. Does the TA feel bad and just pass her? Thereby lowering the university's bar and ultimately leading to its international renown?;
	      Competition breeds what? And I won't even allow you in the game if you haven't the eyes for the sport. Why the lack of educational interest in this country these days? We're importing more students from India and Asia to fill the intellectual coffers than we are for Chinese Sudafed to fill the demand for Midwestern meth-labs. And it's sad, but look to the hero/anti-hero emblems of pop-culture across the States. Ok, so the country's makeup is yet now roughly 60 percent white, 14 percent American-American and 13 percent Latino, with the rest Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Native.;
	    I understand if one grows up without a father, if neither parent has graduated high-school. I see the multitudes of strain among those who find their immediate environment riddled with nothing less than law-breakers: with the pimps and dealers flashing cash and revving the Cadillac engines their grandparents migrated north from the southern Deltas to refine.  Sure, it's an uphill climb. Inner-City Detroit graduates something like 13 percent of its teens, with only 1 percent actually passing Michigan's minimal standards testing. ;

I am behind you Mr President, keep fighting for the right and just causes that make America Great. Take care Mr President. I'm sorry that some wont agree with me but close your eyes and open your heart for a few moments and listen to what this content conveys and trust that it isnt just talk. Challenge me if you must but to dispute a President and his administration that truly wants to work hard and is honestly beholding to no one except American citizens is fruitless.;

	6:33 BEE MOVIE WHAT UP;
	Power back to the people;
	*FCC VOTES TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY*;
	Mussolini type speech but in (idiot proof) English;
	In the words of George W. Bush, "That's some weird shit." , ;
	Nearly one year down, seven more years to go. #maga;
	LETS FACE IT!  DONALD TRUMP HAS MANAGED THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT MITT ROMNEY DID IN 2012.  HE IS PRESENTING AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT WILL NOT CREATE JOBS HERE AT HOME.  HE WANTS TO KEEP TAXES LOW FOR HIS RICH BUDDIES (TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS).  YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS?  THE RICH GETS RICHER AND THE POOR GETS PREGNANT.  AND HE IS PRESENTING A FOREIGN POLICY THAT IS WRONG AND RECKLESS.;
	I PREDICT THAT UNDER DONALD TRUMPS PRESIDENCY IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FROM JANUARY 20, 2017 TO NOVEMBER 3, 2020, THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMY WILL CREATE AT LEAST 5 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS OR LESS.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS WILL MOVE OVERSEAS.  AND UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS LEADERSHIP, THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STARTED AT 10.0% AND HAS NOW DECREASED TO 4.1%.  I PREDICT THAT UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMPS LEADERSHIP, THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WILL INCREASE FROM 4.1% TO 12.0%.;
	SINCE JANUARY 1961, FOR THE PAST 57 YEARS (SINCE WE HAD ALL 50 STATES), THE DEMOCRATS HAVE OCCUPIED THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 28 YEARS. AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE OCCUPIED FOR 29 YEARS.  FOR THE PAST 57 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMY HAS PRODUCED 79.0 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.  SO HERE IS THE JOBS SCORE: REPUBLICANS  25.7 MILLION, AND THE DEMOCRATS  53.3 MILLION.  IT IS TO SHOW THAT JOBS CREATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES EXTREMELY WELL UNDER DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS THAN UNDER REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS.;
	WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS THAT (ACCORDING TO WWW.WIKIPEDIA.ORG) DONALD TRUMP WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WITH 304 ELECTORAL VOTES AND HILLARY CLINTON WON 227 ELECTORAL VOTES (WHICH MAKE NO FUCKIN SENSE).  BUT HILLARY CLINTON WON THE NATIONWIDE POPULAR VOTE WITH 65,853,516, WHILE DONALD TRUMP WON 62,984,825 POPULAR VOTES (WHICH ALSO MAKES NO FUCKIN SENSE).  I BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SHOULD BE ABOLISHED BECAUSE IT IS A SYSTEM THAT IS GETTING OLD AND OUTDATED.  AND ANY OF YOU DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS CONDEMN THIS MESSAGE, YOU CAN SUCK MY WEENIE FOR ALL I CARE!;
	Trump 2020!!;
	I actually expected alot of Trump hate in the comments, but then I realized, his haters wouldnt watch this video.  They dont listen to what he actually says, they wait for the media tell them how what he says is terrible and makes him a racist. Im proud to have Trump as my president.    MAGA;
	Low taxes. Hell yeah!;
	I don't support you or hate/oppose you Sir, I just fully respect you as the President Of The United States Of America. (Salute) Godspeed Mr President. I hope you Make America Great Again.;
	When I listen to Donald Trump talk I don't believe anything he says.;
	Over 500k homeless. Wages well below what they should be. Pharmaceutical/ medical field bloated and unnecessarily overgrown. Build the wall, sort out the illegals. Require police to wear uniform cameras. Do NOT encourage police violence on anyone. Do NOT comment on court cases. Draw down ALL foreign deployments. Obviate ALL foreign aid.;
	Maybe a good speech......but he didnt write it.;
	That's some weird shit;
	Why do I have to deal with this fucking idiot?;
	President Trump Told the D.C. Swamp right to their globalist faces, "we the people" voted against you by rejecting Hillary Clinton. , ;
	TJ KIRK FOR PRESIDENT!!!;
	Rand Paul Troll him 11:57;
	God's man for the hour...like it or not.;
	he's been in there for one year and so far he's doing an okay job;
	I very like Donal Trump-he is a strong man.;
	So grateful to be able to call him my President. 8 years, baby!;
	obama looks like he is eating crow. i know what i would be saying to myself if i were him. should have kept my mouth shut at that dinner when i dared trump to run. i wonder does he blame himself at all for trump. could he be the one who gave us trump. thanks a lot obama.;
	I think it's pretty solid at this point that any city failing in America is because of progressive policies...;
	One of the greatest days in our history finally a man who will change our path for the better and honor God at the same time.;

	As a veteran school teacher who had to watch NOBAMA make schools dangerous over his lax discipline policies (read link), I hope Trump will MAKE EDUCATION GREAT AGAIN! ;
	https://nypost.com/2017/12/23/obamas-lax-discipline-policies-made-schools-dangerous/;
	Students hitting students means Suspension. Student hitting Teachers means expulsion. I mean how downgrading and disrespectful towards ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. Why don't you throw dirt on them while your at it.;
	HOW MANY STUDENTS HAVE BULLIED TEACHERS TO DEATH DO TO THIS LACK OF DISCIPLINE AND DOUBLE STANDARD? Let's put children first when it comes to Death Instead of adults, doing what they should be doing by taking the bullet for the child. Yeah I approve of this policy. its somewhat more fair to the students you know THE CHILDREN! How bout Expulsion for both. Then schools would be alot safer.;
	 It's written fact that there was a time on this land when people didn't kill eachother. But lefts and rights aren't talking about that       I WONDER WHY.;
	Im just looking for a timestamp for the bane speech;

	#MAGA    No no no no no no  CATLINS CREED        there we go that's real freedom.   Trump's not talking about that kind of freedom is he? I wonder why.   Because it happened in America before it was called America.     Die Obama, Clinton you Zionists.;

	oh shit the camera recording me;
	Germany should be proud of themselves, France, the people, not the idiots that try to rule them.  The pursuit of happiness.  Let's, all countries, unite, or they will do whatever they like.  It is time to KILL all of the kings.;
	Amen.;
	did you see the new executive order? that Q-anon stuff is legit after all, he is targeting human rights violators that have business and money here in the U.S. (and this includes sex traffickers);
	I will tell you the truth, our president has BALLS! Power to the People! He has sent a warning to The Swamp and he will succeed. That is Donald Trump! He is a Godsend to America!;
	Obamas face is priceless. Its like he just realized that Trump is going to wipe out all of his accomplishments;
	Almost a year passed. Can't remember what he did tremendously wrong. Let's hope it will stay like that. Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to you all!;

	6:34 HE JACKED IT FROM BEE MOVIE THIS GUY COPIED THE MOST MEMED MOVIE OF ALL TIME ABOUT HUMAN BEE LOVE. YOU LIKE JAZZ, DONNY?;
	Its funny because ever since Trump came in power, we have been laughed at, mocked, and looked down upon. The second he came in power, other countries have stopped inviting him over to other countries. Look at how much foreign countries Obama visited in his first 6 months of presidency and compare it to Trumps first 6 months. Its overwhelming btw.;
	Luke Arvey ;
	Because the media portrayed Trump as a bad guy this entire year;
	That's why MOST countries did not invite Trump;

	The only two things that I don't like about him are that he supports Israel over Palestine & that he isn't a REAL SUNNI Muslim ;
	But other than that, he's the best president of America in the 21st century;
	He really does have little hands......haha;
	Well he didn't mentioned taking social security away or medicare but he did mentioned throwing folks off of welfare and putting them to work.  Unemployment is at an all time high.  Hiring US workers that's a joke I'm laughing at now.  Microsoft hires from India and China brings them here to work for less	 Intel is doing the same thing with that special program where they get take breaks and because they have work permits they work here for less.  He is protecting our borders right now (yeah right).  How does he think he is going to protect us from a nuclear bomb that is staring us right in the face with North Korea.  He is thumbing his nose at the people of color and forcing them to be patriotic when there way of being patriotic is kneeling during football games.  We're not Germany and the majority hasn't been brainwashed yet Into this Nationalism Patriotic rhetoric he is talking about.  God what about Jesus and the sermon on the mount?  Thou shall not kill seems to be part of the Ten Commandments -- Infrastructure where?  Texas can't find anyone to rebuild their homes and it's in shambles and we're not seeing it.  Puerto Rico is in shambles and businesses are talking about leaving it and our government (we the people aren't helping them) with the food and water that they desperately need;
	FDR, JFK, and Donald J. Trump. The only 3 presidents that actually did something for America over the last century.;

	One, god knows what you were fed to think like that, cause I keep finding more and more proof he is the man for the job.;
	Two.........you seriously need to look up what a centrist actually means. If you don't see what's wrong with that then...;
	Do you see his  M.A.G.A. talking or looking anything like this youtube video      Russel Means George Catlin Creed       WHERE THE FUCKS YOUR M.A.G.A. NOW! I think I'll take that instead!;

	I know does it get any better than Russell Means;
	I love how that big body guard was blocking Hillary Clinton at the end there.;
	And he gives power back to the people by appointing a load of rich guys and cutting taxes for the rich while making it worse on the poor.;
	that is a misrepresentation of everything he run on. the idea was instead of tax the rich and give to the poor, or scare the rich off completely into leaving the shores, he campaigned to lower the taxes of the rich and force the incentive to employ the poor, open up factories and put unemployed to work so that they can live happily and make money, that is the demographic that elected him wants.;
	This speech sent shivers down my spine looking back at it a year later and seeing how hes kept his promises to the American people. I can imagine Obama and crew were sizzling in their seats like a possessed people  enduring an exorcism. They all wanted to shoot him dead at that moment but were petrified of the presence of the spirit of the lord entering into the people once again.;
	Carlos Chiriboga ;
	Pay close attention to the first two minutes of the speech when he surrounded himself with the military. There was a meaning behind that, there are no coincidences with this man. He was telling the deep state that a new sheriff was in town. I will never get sick of watching that moment. He knew then what he was going to do, get rid of the corruption. God Bless this brave man.;
	First I was pissed that he was President, now I'm just used to it. ;
	This was epic and hes draining the swamp again;
	PREDICTION!!!TRUMP WINS AGAIN IN 2020 WITH A BIGGER MARGIN!!;
	I think I speak for all brits here. No matter who is elected nothing will happen;
	you haven't been paying attention to what he has been doing then cousin(stuff the media isn't reporting on). if you go to the website of the white house you can look up all the things he has passed or done so far, in a single year, I'm honestly impressed.;

	He swoops in and acts as a hero. "Enough is enough!" Enough of the corruption in Washington! So, what happens next? , ;
	lol look how small that crowd is;
	Firsto Frado Yep. Sorry, all the conservatives were too busy working so they could pay high taxes for your welfare.;
	One of the finest speeches ever;
	Can someone kill him. Hes useless.;
	nothing to see here... just another tolerant progressive calling for the death of a world leader with different opinions from theirs;
	Nobody showed up. No one who matters in the world likes him. Rich or famous..no one...expect has beens like tim allen . and trailer trash retards who live off welfare.;
	Here Here bless Trump l see more accomplished   when they have in years of fauls promises;
	America has found their "Greatest Ever" President in this man,!!  God Bless and Protect him,!! , ;
	I wonder who are god's chosen people to him? uh as he says?;
	people can't see the deceit in a loud mouth full of promises. he's not there for the people but for himself and his slut daughter he has incestuously had three children with! it's obviously who he intends to make first lady of the White house if not the "queen of America" as I suppose he will dub his family the royals of America at the tax payer's expense. I wonder how much of that money he bought off the military for himself with! , ;
	fuck trump;
	la mayor And fuck you too.;
	Not many minorities in the audience.;
	Remember those days when we all thought 2016 was the worst year.... sigh;
	Is it just me, or did Obama look genuinely proud of Trump's speech at the end;
	MAGA!;
	Catlins's Creed!    He's not talking about that is heeeee. I didn't think sooooo.;
	God bless our President!!! MAGA;
	Catlin's Creed Rapes your MAGA in the Ass!    Die Obama and Clinton.;
	That was some weird shit;
	He did not write this speech. Who is his boss i wonder? Puppeteer, he is just the face of an organization that really runs the show. Whatever you believe in doesn't really matter, the invisible people are those who hold all the power.;
	Best day ever;
	Remember. Never ignore that last Orange Popsicle in the back of your freezer. It just might grow legs and become President of the United Sates.;
	orange boi;
	I just hope this guy doesn't destroy the world.;
	aryamanW He won't;
	More dislikes;
	I'm so glad I was in the hospital on election day so I don't have to live with the guilt of putting this sociopath in office.;
	Just remember his promise that by the end of his presidency that he would destroy Islamic Terror. Lets see if he follows through on his promises better than other presidents like Trump supporters expect.;
	is that wild scott adams at 9:08 ?;
	Trump2020;
	Love trump;
	He sounds, postures and grimaces like Mussolini on his way up.  Hope Melania at least escapes the Mussolini's ultimate fate - not at the hands of the victorious Allies,  but at the hands of his own furious, betrayed and embittered "People". , ;
	Hillary in an interview most recently, called this a dark speech only for Trump's supporters. Wtf? The "People", not "white-nationalists". , ;
	Scripted by Bannon, the bloated cynic, who actually had/has no regard for "the People" who he sees as the means of installing and manipulating  political numbskull, whose only true talent still is selling snake-oil remedies to people with real, complex problems in which Bannon has no genuine interest. , ;
	What a gullible nation you are;
	Michael Obama;
	Clinton went on a BBC talk show and said that President Trump's speech here was 'dark and divisive' and a 'cry from the white nationalist gut'... listen to the speech and you won't find anything to support her claims.;
	That was some weird shit - GW Bush;
	God Bless President Trump!!;
	Good leader for America;

	I don't understand.  The United States of America is NOT your wheelhouse for 'the world'.  Fuck the world, where is your damn wall and fulfilment of false promises?  Your OATH is to protect and defend the constitution of the United States!;
	I can't wait for the day I read on the news he's died!!!!!!! The entire world will celebrate. Or at least the people who aren't MENTALLY ILL will celebrate.;
	Phon Productions You don't even live in America, what do you know about our intelligence? Also the reason I sometimes mistake the PM for Her Majesty is because I hear other people and news reporters calling the PM Her Majesty.;

	I support this 200%;
	8:35 BUTT HURT ;
	38k > 25k MAKE AMERICAGREAT AGAIN!!!;
	Why did he has to say "for the first time ever the 45th potus" ?????? Like there will be more 45th presidents?? This is not a boxing match bro , ;
	JFK put a man on the moon, Obama put a man in the women's restroom, and Trump put the woman (Hillary) back in the kitchen.;
	Did you notice the sea of white millenials.;
	DasGeek1 no;
	Liberals, you showed America how hateful, childish, psycho, whiney, anti American, and how destructive you are after this election and you sealed trump winning in 2020 already as more people will vote against your party now that you showed how mentally ill you really are and it will be a very long time before you get in office again. I can't thank you enough lol;
	since then the country has been upside down with the orange guy;
	That was some weird shit. George W. Bush;
	He speaking another language with his hands,do y'all see it;
	R.I.P America;
	Theres JFK ;
	Then theres this guy ...;
	WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS THAT (ACCORDING TO WWW.WIKIPEDIA.ORG) DONALD TRUMP WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WITH 304 ELECTORAL VOTES AND HILLARY CLINTON WON 227 ELECTORAL VOTES (WHICH MAKE NO FUCKIN SENSE). BUT HILLARY CLINTON WON THE NATIONWIDE POPULAR VOTE WITH 65,853,516, WHILE DONALD TRUMP WON 62,984,825 POPULAR VOTES (WHICH ALSO MAKES NO FUCKIN SENSE).  I BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SHOULD BE ABOLISHED BECAUSE IT IS A SYSTEM THAT IS GETTING OLD AND OUTDATED.;
	AND ANY OF YOU DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS CONDEMN THIS MESSAGE, YOU CAN SUCK MY WEENIE FOR ALL I CARE!;
	Frijolero Man79 hmmm that's wierd how come you didn't want it abolished when Obama won 2 terms lol? Are you retarded so go by popular vote so all they would have to do is rally in ny and CA cause they have the highest population lol yeah that makes sense great idea. Man you liberals are a breed of your own. Change the whole system cause your candidate lost lol you didn't see Republicans wanting to do that when Obama destroyed the country for 2 terms did you? Suck it up snowflake this is life and not everyone gets a trophy sorry. Can't change the system just because you lost wipe your tears get a therapy dog and play dough the sun will still come up tomorrow.;
	SINCE JANUARY 1961, FOR THE PAST 56 YEARS (SINCE WE HAD ALL 50 STATES), THE DEMOCRATS HAVE HELD THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 28 YEARS. AND THE REPUBLICANS ALSO HELD FOR 28 YEARS. FOR THE PAST 56 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMY HAS PRODUCED 78.4 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. SO HERE IS THE JOBS SCORE: REPUBLICANS  25.1 MILLION, AND THE DEMOCRATS  53.3 MILLION. IT IS TO SHOW THAT JOBS CREATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES EXTREMELY WELL UNDER DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS THAN UNDER REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS.;
	I PREDICT THAT UNDER DONALD TRUMPS PRESIDENCY IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FROM JANUARY 20, 2017 TO;
	NOVEMBER 3, 2020, THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ECONOMY WILL CREATE AT LEAST 5 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS OR LESS.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS WILL MOVE OVERSEAS.  AND UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS LEADERSHIP, THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STARTED AT 10.0% AND HAS NOW DECREASED TO 4.3%. I PREDICT THAT UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMPS LEADERSHIP, THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WILL INCREASE FROM 4.3% TO 12.0%.;
	Frijolero Man79 lmfaoooo my god you are retarded aren't you under obama there was more people on welfare and food stamps then ever in American history it's a fact let alone he drove us farther in debt in 1 term then the last two presidents combined.you can go tear down your Obama shrine now lol wtf man you are so so so so retarded and uneducated to facts it's not even funny lol;
	LETS FACE IT! DONALD TRUMP HAS MANAGED THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT MITT ROMNEY DID IN 2012. HE IS PRESENTING AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT WILL NOT CREATE JOBS HERE AT HOME. HE WANTS TO KEEP TAXES LOW FOR HIS RICH BUDDIES (TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS). YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN TRICKLE-DOWN;
	ECONOMICS? THE RICH GETS RICHER AND THE POOR GETS PREGNANT. AND HE IS PRESENTING A FOREIGN POLICY THAT IS WRONG AND RECKLESS.;
	only sensible comment in this entire thread.. and it's in all caps lol;
	A Grand Slam for Trump #45  we love You  and Yours Godspeed  Thank you for affirming America . I believe that you've rallied the American spirit not just of flesh but of spirit M .A .G .A..;
	There's only a little bit of people at trump ignageration but Obama had a lot what happen to trumps people;

	Jack Myers no I think I'm good;

	Chris O I do believe it's president donny if ya don't like it take the rest of the lunatic anti American liberals with you and leave. You won't be missed. Bye now lol;
	Garbage in, garbage out. This r*tard only exists bc of the blind hate of stupid whites. I love low education voters, no shiz!!;
	I like how when they give him the silent treatment and he stops talking they applaud.;
	Trumps crowd is made up of white racists;
	And had she won, Hillary's crowds would have been made up of a bunch of brainwashed idiots like you.;
	Lol that smug asshole Obama deserves everything they will throw at him. Piece of shit.;
	Michelle Obama was dressed in a red trench coat that was buttoned up tight, showing complete defiance, refusing too look as glamorous as she did as First lady, and the look of scorn and madness on her very expressive face says it all.;
	Marvin King lmfaoo Michelle Obama looks like Chewbacca and I still say she's a he;
	it started to rain,,,sign of the devil..;
	Great inauguration address! President Donald Trump did a great job laying out what needs to be done to Make America strong Again, Make America Wealthy Again, Make America Proud Again, Make America Safe Again, and Make America Great Again!;
	Especially as a Mexican-American war veteran,  proudly to have served in Afghanistan,  I can honestly be disgusted in trump.  However,  glad the way worse killary Clinton lost and still think even trump could make a difference. Haven't seen much difference at all though.;
	i love Donald Trump;
	Yes, I heard it was really something, & so it was. Now we have to save the country from him.;
	thank god we got a president with balls!!!!! trump is the man!!!!!!;

	This is a very divisive speech yeah it is some weird shit. I agree with GWB and no it wasn't as full as Obama's ignaguration they even make more noise just accept it. Smh;
	The globalist elites are scared of him.;
	Kristen Jett not that bright I see. Explains why I am coming across you here. Sorry Kristen but if you still havent realized youve been bamboozled than there is likely no hope for you corporatist sleeze bags.;
	I'm just stating my opinion, so all you kiss ups to Trump don't get mad. Ok, how could you let a pig become president, He's going to ban all Muslims. Not all Muslims are bad first of all he's saying that because of September 11th, 2001. Like who would vote for him? he treats women like they are just trash and have no meaning when he said "grab them by the p**sy" are you freaking kidding me. and when he said "blood coming out of her... whatever" we all know he was referring to a woman when she has her period, like FR god made women a different way than he made men but does that mean women are supposed to get treated horrible, no. If it wasn't for Donald Trump's mom having her period he wouldn't even be here, yeah so don't disrespect women, because we all know you wouldn't say that stuff to your mom, and if you would then you are so ungrateful to your mother. personally I love my mother and I would never say that to her. for all the DONALD TRUMP SUPORTERS,HELLO. , ;
	Still better then Hillary sorry but that's not as bad as a girl getting a rapist and child molester off and laughing about it. Is that supportive to female rights? Let alone her letting Americans die. Saying grab a girl by the pussy is worse then that to you?;
	Lmaoooo this is even funnier 7 months later... funny yet sad! In reflection, the past 7 months has been like a bad dream;
	I cried.. it was a moving speech, but wait aunt I suppose to be a white supremacist if I like trump? but I'm black so there;
	>children;
	0:17 What a fucking narcissist. He asked if he could get his own introduction in writing. XD Watch the video later if you want to atake a stroll down memory lane homie.. XD America and the rest of the fucking world don't want any keepsakes of your goddamn presidency.;
	WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!! #MAGA;
	Martu go to fukn hell and get raped;
	Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump's was white nationalist, I am trying to find the racist part of the speech. I was a threat to the 1%.;
	Red894336643 I dont find it hard to find the racist part in almost everything he says on a daily basis. He just read off of a paper.;

	WOW!! That was the best speeches I've ever heard in the history of US Presidents;
	Isn't it a bit scary speaking in front of millions of people.;
	Did you know that Trump trademarked the phrase, "make America great again"? He did it before he started running. I guess he knew it would be his campaign phrase. , ;

	Juan Salazar look where it got you;
	Great man and great leader President Trump;
	Mega Big Marn no he is not;
	All the DNC had to do was nominate Bernie Sanders, and everything would be great(for real). Instead, they nominated Hillary, completely screwed themselves, and pretty much gave the presidency to this buffoon. Sure Hillary still won the popular vote, but that doesn't matter much. The DNC pretty much worked against itself with identity politics, political correctness, and selling out to donors and special interests. Hillary is at least competent, so we would be marginally better of with her in the White House. But people clearly didn't want her because she's a corrupt corporatist fuck. How hard was that to get? Maybe they'll get it right in 2020, assuming we still have a country and an open internet by then. This asshat's FCC is hell-bent on undoing net neutrality and letting telecoms control how we can use the internet for their gain. Thanks a lot, DNC, you fucking idiots. We might as well impeach Trump now and have him take his disastrous appointees with him. Hopefully we can nail Mike Pence in time. We are seriously screwed if this degenerate is allowed to have a few more months as president.;

Not even the best fiction filmmakers could do such a scenario.... How can a PRESIDENT be so irrational? Even if Hillary was from the "system" , isn't Donald Trump that kind of people that we laughed at a circus?

	This was such an amazing day and speech. When I first heard this, it felt like America is finally back. The last 4 years of Obama forced me to leave the left, and we pushed hard to get Trump elected, and prevent the DNC from continuing the corruption. Many of us are not fans of the RNC either. Trump was the populist president.;

	That's some weird stuff going on.;
	How low this world has gone. We are not civil, nor caring. We're fighting ourselves and give empty insults to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. We surround ourselves with those who agree with us, and undermine the intelligence of our opponents. Who are we? Why? Why have we sunken so low. Insult me and spread lies but the truth, I've lost hope, hope in everyone, everything. It's no matter anymore. What a terrible world.;
